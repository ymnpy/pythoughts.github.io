    <h1>possible AI impacts</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        Well, I've wanted to write something to keep this blog going on (I must admit that I see it now kind of obligation now, an obligation to stay in touch with writing) and I decided to take a look at on my old notes and I found some notes about a book that I have read before about AI (artificial intelligence) and wanted to share it so I can stay consistent on writing.
        </p>

        <p>
        The book is called <i>Artificial Intelligence: 101 Things You Must Know Today About Our Future</i> and it is written by Finnish author Lasse Rouhiainen. I must say that I don't agree with the <i>must</i> part because these predictions about the future are merely guesses and when it comes to AI, there are many unknowns in the equation that lowers the accuracy of these predictions. So, I keep that in my mind and I just try to get some knowledge about the subject and try to expand my thought horizon let's say. The book does not have a tough, academic language to read; it is rather easy to follow (though I read it in Turkish). It generally gives rough, general knowledge about AI without too much details. It does that by dividing the subject into kind of 101 lessons and mentions robots, companies, countries, economic market from the perspective of AI impact.

        If we come to the points that I took from the book; first of all, the book does not represent that dark AI picture, where AI takes over control and end humanity (things you would hear from Nick Bostrom or Eliezer Yudkowsky) which seems a bit science-fiction compared to what is written in this book. Because, the things mentioned in this books are familiar stuff which we know or experienced already. The things are mentioned in this book is like a distant horizon but no so distant we we can actually see some trees on the land, or its coast etc. I also find quite good those passages where the author enable us to think about AI. I think we should think about these technologies (not everybody perhaps but people work in tech or engineering maybe). It is worth to think about usage of AI in our businesses, its integration in our social life without any harm. How can we be ensure about its dangers and how to maximize its benefits ? These thoughts may be useful for the future of humanity.

        I already can sense that AI is possibly going to be used in lots of jobs including my own. I have also been experiencing its benefits in my own profession as well, since I was coding some machine learning stuff in my leisure times. AI is called <i>new electricty</i> by some, <i>4. scientific paradigm</i> by others. It is quite logical to accept that <i>"Car comes with car accident."</i> which means that this technology quite possibly will also bring some harm. I want to say maybe governments must do something against it but I doubt it even if they picture they are doing something against it. I know that for instance USA government exploit computer vulnerabilities by producing malwares to use against other countries. We also see that how <i>international ethics</i> (I don't want to call it laws) are useless, empty as we see tyrant, occupier, murderer i$rael committing a genocide in Gaza. Therefore, AI regulations won't be a constraint for those countries who has some kind of authority over others. USA or China presumably, will use AI in their drones, weapons etc. So, good people of the world should prepare themselves, both in offensive and defensive manner.

        It is impossible to predict future, it is only known by Allah. But if I need to talk about the subject more and make some guesses, probably most of the jobs will be a history and unemployed people by this result, if they can not adjust themselves to that new era will stay unemployed. This may expand to distance between social classes more and increase the wealth distribution, because more and more people is going to be pushed to the bottom of the economic ladder. Corporations, most likely tech ones who holds this technologies will get richer and richer I assume. We may even hear some of the current ones will declare bankruptcy and some other companies replaces them with some unknown technology productions that we don't know yet. So if economic structure changes, most of other structures of the society changes as well. Thus, it seems that the change will be big by the full AI implementation to the world. Also thinking about the adaptation phase; it won't be enough, because the speed of improvement in technology exceeds the speed of human adaptation to it and this is not good. Let us say only repetitive tasks will replaced by AI, but what is going to happen then ? Lack of goal can bring psychological disorders. We may see more and more decrease in mental health in humans. Additionally, it is most possible that we will also see more social isolation, loneliness, decrease in birth rates. It is plausible that some humans will live in virtual environments more than the real world. This is not a hopeful scenario.

        I heard a quote in somewhere online which goes like <i>"High tech, low life."</i>, I guess this quote depicts the picture pretty well.
