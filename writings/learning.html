        I have read the book called <a href="https://www.tinkitap.com/ogrenmeyi-ogrenmek"><i>"Learning to Learn" (Öğrenmeyi Öğrenmek)</i></a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJafeVIno1uSkmuWZtGKRw">Altay Cem Meriç</a> recently. I have known Altay Cem Meriç for quite some time, I have been listening to him and I love the guy. So therefore, wanted to buy one of his books actually ended up buying more than one book from him, the other one is <a href="https://www.tinkitap.com/https//wwwtinkitapcom/ogrenmeyi-ogrenmek-172866426618-172866427320"><i>Proof of Prophethood (Peygamberliğin İspatı)</i></a> but have not read this one yet. Anyways, I want to share some of the important points from the book (Learning to Learn) here and write about them. Though even the title of the book is really something important to think about "learning to learn". It is one of the best skills that you can get as a person, because life is a journey and to learn new things well, is a great tool to carry with yourself.

        The book as it can be sensed from the title, conveys some ideas, practices about learning activity. It is written about: time management, current school system, academia, which books to choose, cross reading etc. Altay Cem Meriç (the author) gives his own ideas from his own perspective and experiences and if you think about it in most cases it is the only way. What I am talking about it is <b>"talking about matters from your experiences or perspective."</b> The author mentioned in the book that basically, he experience the world as himself than tries to generalize from there. This is the basic process of having sociological or physchological or anything human related ideas right ? You start from a human being and who is better example than ownselves. If we are hurt from a thing we kind of understand that this may hurt all other human beings as well so we establish the idea of "this thing is hurtful". I have found this point beatiful. These are one of those things you just know but did not really put it into a sentence before, never seen in written but you kind of knew it, generalizing from your own experiences and increasing the accuracy of this generalization through trials and errors (it sounded like a machine learning training process but machine learning is imitation of human learning, so no surprise there).

        Another point I have found in the book and had the same idea for sometime is the <b>working on something you like</b>. I definitely agree with that as long as what you like is not a harmful thing. From time to time I had the opportunity of talking with youngsters and giving them advices and I told them (atleast one or some of them) that "work on what you like" or "read about what you like" it does not have to be related to your major in your university. For instance if you are studying engineering it is fine to read about birds and I did similar stuff. Because for once you work bettern on things that you like, that you are curious about and for the second it is fun and once its fun you spend more time working on that subject, you learn more, things become more long lasting etc. It just increases the overall learning quality. Also, knowing information about various subjects is important. I am not on the team of <b>vertical learning</b> as it is described in the book as <i>knowing one subject/discipline in a very detailed way</i> I am more like a person of <b>horizontal learning</b> as it is also described in the book with kind of words as the following: <i>knowing many subjects above introduction level</i>. Yes, I like that one, horizontal learning, these are described as polymath or hezarfen in the book and working on what you like drive person towards such characterization. Because as a human you are curious about many things and if you are not lazy, you end up learning those things from broad range of topics. It helps you to see things from a different perspective, you apply biology in engineering, you solve a problem in chemistry through computer science etc. It also helps person to innovate and synthesize different bits and pieces from different disciplines to come up with something new. So, I strongly agree with the advice of saying "work on what you like as long as it is not harmful."

        Lastly, I'd like to talk about another beatiful statement in the book that goes something like <b>"warming is beatiful after you are cold, resting is beatiful after you are tired"</b>. This is a really valuable lesson. You don't really get that amazing taste of relaxing or resting unless you really worked hard just before it. If you are not cold yet and you are warming, this warming is not enjoyable it is kind of annoying. Same thing applies to get rest and to get tired. As it is also stated in the book that once lazy person tries to get rest it is only boring because that person does not have the prequisite of resting to make it enjoyable which is hard working. Just imagine getting back to home sitting on a comfortable chair, or lying on the bed after a tired day. It is enjoyable right ? It is like sitting on clouds kind of comfortness on that moment. That tiredness amplified the resting multiple times. Or imagine eating your favourite meal after not eating something for a long time. You probably would say something like "this is one of the best meals I have ever eaten". So the point is, study or work hard on something valuable then get the rest for that amazing feel for both knowing that you studied on something good, you improved yourself and you reached that beatiful rest at the end of it.

        These are three important subjects among many others from the book. I really enjoyed reading it and I recommend it. I also would like to thank Altay Cem Meriç for such good quality work. May Allah be pleased with him.
