        Freedom, a frequently used word in the world, throughout to history. It is dear to the humankind and is very important for both psychologically
        and physically. Many people have fought for it, many people are still fighting for it and many other people are deceived about it. I want to talk about the deception part and what I think what <i>freedom</i> is.

        I think total freedom, absolute form of it is not possible. Such concept is just an illusion but I don't deny the word completely, I just believe that people are not aware of its meaning fully. Total freedom, the absolute form of it is not possible because you are, as a human being are a constrained form of life. You are constrained by your desires, by other people's influence on it, by societal acceptance, by your own physical capabilities etc. You will always be bound to somethings that contradicts with the absolute freedom concept. Let's give some examples about it: western people under the influence of liberalism thinks that they are free but they are mostly bound to their own desires. They are slaves to their own internal whispers, some may call it consciusness, I call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs">nafs</a> and we know that it does not command good and people are just doing its orders and thinking they are free, this is a delusion. To people who might say "this is the freedom, you are following your own internal orders, who cares it is bad", I would answer that "you care and you should" think about those times you are telling to yourself "no I must not do it because it is bad for me" and still you are doing it, because you have no control over yourself, you have given control to your nafs and following it which discard the concept of freedom. The examples can be multiplied, think about people who are following any societal norm/order in order to be accepted by them, they are obviously not free or think about a soldier who is blindly following order of his commander's order eventhough the order is about harming innocent people, not free again. These people are deceived, they might think they are free but they are not. Of course, people are oppressed under an oppressor wants their freedom rightfully and these people are not deceived, they know that they are not free and are fighting for it, patiently waiting for it but even after they get their physical freedom lets say, they still have to fight with other so called masters whether its their own desires, money, society etc. I guess they have increased their freedom bar greatly by getting free of the hands of that oppressor but can we say they are free 100% ? I don't think so.

        So in this case, the most freedom is about autonomy. If you decide when to get up, when to leave your home, when to eat, what orders to follow, don't care about every people's opinion, don't follow orders blindly, able to say "No" to people then you can talk about your freedom. But there is one important thing is, I purposely used the word "autonomy" and changed "having control over your own life" because the second one is not possible. You can't stop your heart, you can't cure yourself from a disease, you can't decide when to die etc. So everybody has a master and among the religious people, muslims, have the correct master, Allah. We follow Allah's orders, we submit ourselves to Him and we accept the fact that we are His slave and not those things I mentined before, nothing else. He has fully control over our lives and everything. I must say that this is one of the best feelings ever because you do not need to worry about other people's opinions, sayings, their acceptance etc. It just breaks your chains whether you are aware of them or not. It is much more easier to say "No" to them and to yourself when it is necessary. This is the most freedom one can get. When people think about the word "freedom" they should picture such state, otherwise they are just delusional.
