    <h1>the education of the will</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Back in the November 2023, I read <i>the education of the will by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Payot">Jules Payot</a></i> second time. I had my notes so, after approximately one year later I am sharing them.

            I read the book twice and not only that, I actually bought it twice. Because as far as I can remember, I borrowed away the first copy I had and I did not come back. I don't think there is ill intention but, people please don't do that. Give your borrowed books back to their owners as soon as possible. Anyways, the book overall contains good and beneficial advices, some sentences are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism">aphorisms</a>; they have short, concise and clean message. For instance a quote taking from Pascal shows such aphorism (I am paraphrasing it): <i>To warm up is beatiful after you are cold and to relax is beatiful after you work hard.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            The book is also identifies some of the enemies of the will and gives some advices to fight against and strengthen our will. For example the book mentiones that, since the lust (the harmful one) kind of drugs the mind and lead to bad acts; the one who is under the influence of this lust is almost acting like an animal (with only raw instinct, without deep thoughts) and after this effect is gone feels shame, disgust, fatigue. Also the wasting of time is another additional lost to all those.
        </p>

        <p>
            All these passages aside from the book, the thing I understood from the book, the main idea is the following: <b>the ideas which are supported by the emotions makes the actions</b>. This includes the good and bad actions. Therefore, whenever one has the thought of this harmful lust starting in their mind, immediately one must extinguish it and leave that state of mind. This reminds me of one of the commandment of Allah (s.w.t.) which is (as an english translation): 
            
            <blockquote>
                <b>Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful feed and evil way.</b><i>(Surah Al-Isra, Ayat 32, english translation)</i>
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Because this feeling is not something to fight or struggle against all the time, even the thought of struggle, makes it the focus in one's mind and may strengthen its influence. So just forget about the harmful lust, run away from it, leave it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thoughts that must be feed, must enlarge are should be the good ones. These can be working hard for a right thing, being courageous, virtuous, helping others etc. The book specifically talk about emotions frequently which is a big part of human life, we are emotional creatures right ? I sometimes think about starting a conversation by saying "Don't get me wrong but ..." or "Don't get emotional but I need to tell you something ..." and feel these are almost impossible things, we are emotional, you can't just shut them off, it is probably close to impossible (or maybe it is impossible). Back to the book, yes the book talks about emotions because a thought which roams around in mind is a weak thing, like a whispering voice but emotions kill them or enlarge them. For instance the author talks about people who goes to church and do bad things, he connects this to the lack of emotional connection to their religion. Therefore they sometimes act against to their religious teachings. On the other hand, when someone see another being whose life in danger, the saving of a life thought becomes stronger and stronger with that emotional state and acts immediately.

            So, the author says that if we strengthen this thought-emotion-action connection, we can gather good habits. Because frequently repeated actions becomes habit and habits are important, as you would agree. Once you have those actions as habits, you have less cognitive load to do them, almost no unwillingness towards them, those actions now gives some sort of joy in a way since they are habit now. It is like decreasing the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-friction-and-dynamic-friction/">friction of action from static to dynamic</a> or maybe even lower. That is a strong idea in my opinion, like a life hack.
        </p>

        <p>
            The author also relate the will to the ability of mind to prevail over impulses and he argues that one can become free in this way. I kind of get the idea of it but I must disagree with that. Because once you have that mind over all other things kind of state, then your mind becomes your master and human mind is not perfect and you can't become free under the shackles of this imperfect entity, so this does not lead to freedom, it may lead to arrogance and such. I believe you are closest to the freedom once you follow the orders of not your mind but infinitely more powerful, knowledgable entity than that, Allah (s.w.t.). Because once you have this understanding, this believe, this knowledge; you are not constrained by the materials of this world. If we talk about real freedom, now that is as close as you can get and it is amazing.

            The author also criticize educational system and he has some knowledge about education as a profession. He writes that instead of teaching the children about thinking, will, having control over themselves etc. the system in his era (and the current system I would say) focus on giving them many informations from different topics through memorization. I also want to add to that by saying current educationl system makes children, socially; kind of docile, a harmless slaves of their system. The current dominated system thinks about itself not about the people.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think the book is quite good if you have the capacity of not taking every word written in there as truth and do your own judgement. I found most of its conclusions logical. I agree with the points of the importance of education of the will, becoming a morally good people, to get away from laziness, harmful acts etc. We need more good humans, people and we should start by becoming one.
