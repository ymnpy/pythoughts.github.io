    <h1>the purpose of this site: writing</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p><i>A note before starting: Let me state that I don't want to use 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a> and other digital stuff heavily, I also want this experience to be fun for me so
            I am mostly write as I am thinking. So, pardon my mistakes in my
            writings both grammarly and idealogically. These are just 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_design_process">preliminary.</a></i>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Okay, let's come to the topic. Why am I writing ? Well, there are many reason to write and its a common action
            some of the humans and I'd doubt it is the action of most of the humans. Some of the motivations
            behind this website and my writings are basically as the following:   
        <ul>
            <li>I like to think about stuff, and writing is an enabler for it.</li>
            <li>I want to be more productive, and writing is a tool for it.</li>
            <li>I feel like writing down your ideas makes you see your mistakes clearly.</li>
            <li>I like to read things, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a> for example. So why not I do it one myself right ?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        You may ask to you yourself, what is it for me ? Why would I care you write or not ? That is a fair question. As I stated above,
        I like to read blogs and some other texts on the web or physical papers. There are benefits in it depending on what you read (I am pretty
        sure there are hundreds of papers defending the benefits of reading). Allow me to write down some of the:

        <ul>
            <li>Learning new things and even if you don't learn anything from these lines, some ideas stays in your mind like a left over cheese in the fridge,
                there might come a time that you may use these ideas to synthese them into new ones, maybe even better ones, as you would make a great meal or upgrade
                the taste of it with that cheese.
            </li>
            <li>It may also motivate you to be more productive. You may even start writing yourself.</li>
            <li>It can help you to appreciate the importance of writing.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
        So you, the reader, by reading these letters you also get benefits
        as I do. You may think this as an intellectual transaction. But unlike any material this transaction does not subtract anything from the parties,
        both sides are just gaining. One might argue we are losing time, but losing it or keeping it is not a choice, its going to be spent regardless so spend
        it wisely, by learning good things for example.
        </p>

        <p>
        So, let me open up some of my ideas here, so we both may benefit.
