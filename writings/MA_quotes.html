    <h1>five quotes from Marcus Aurelius</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I read Marcus Aurelius's infamous book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> couple months ago but still, from time to time, I open it and read some quotes in it. By the way, it is said that Marcus Aurelius has no intention of publication of these writings, he merely wrote them down as a reminder to himself and so the title "meditations" is later given by some other people to this text. The book is consisted of many quotes, and you can sense that Marcus is talking to himself and to make this writings even more interesting, let me remind you that Marcus Aurelius was the Emperor of Rome in that time. He is called the <i>Philsopher-Emperor</i>. I think he is a really important character to investigate and think about, he is different in a good way, with all those temptations of being an emperor you can feel his work towards being decent. Although, I don't agree with some of his opinions mostly because of our religious differentiation, I still find some others valuable. They make you think about the society, humans, nature etc. Moreover, they are still relatable today after 2000 years. I guess in general writings which is focused on human nature still resonates after so many years because essentially humans are the same. Some Marcus Aurelius's quotes (it is believed they are his) are popular in the internet (atleast I came across them more than once), however I want to share my opinion on five of his quotes. I also want to point out that, despite the fact that I generally avoid using ChatGPT (because basically I believe that, LLM models makes thing simpler in the exchange of you actually learn of those things by doing research and struggling) I am going to use its translation capability because my copy of the book is in Turkish, yet I will write the quotes in English.

        <blockquote>
            1) "I have the power to do nothing against my will, for there is no one who can force me to sin against this consciousness."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I believe similar to Marcus Aurelis in this matter. Our creater, Allah, gave us all this ability to resist sin, temptations, doing bad deeds. It just comes down to your choice. Nobody is forcing you. If you can control yourself and think clearly, it is up to you to reject the bad and embrace the good.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            2) "Look into something. Do not let the inner quality or value of anything escape your sight."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Marcus Aurelius mention this idea more than one in his writings, looking into things. He suggest basically we see things as what they really are. This is an important point and applicable today. There are many deceptive strategies out there, just covering the matter and hiding its real intent or nature. We should be careful about it. Not even deceptive matters, even human interactions are subject to this. If someone tells you something that you don't like, try to understand what he/she really means, look through his words, analyze it, try to understand the real intention behind it. Or, look at the modern idelogies, they offer goodness of nations, people; but just think about them really, see through them, do your investigation and ask yourself; do they really have capacity to achieve those goals or are those goals even good for people as they claim or at what expense they can be achieved or are they just some prettified false opinions with many holes at their core ? I believe the latter. I applied this quote to the negative instances but as you can imagine it can also be applied to good things as well, good things that are not seen at first sight and can be seen or be understood as you look into them.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            3) "Contemplating the nature of everything and what happens within it is a task suited for man."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Again, I have similar feelings to this quote. I don't think any other animal; cats or dogs think about the nature or their position in it etc. This task, such contemplations is suited for mankind and humans have been doing that, atleast some of them. It is also enjoyable I think. When I think about the universe, its order, the physical laws put there by Allah (s.w.t.), I feel like I am doing something according to my nature, it gives me some sort of satisfaction especially when I kind of understand them, the nature. So there is a value in understading the nature or universe, not just by means of so we can engineer some stuff to make human lives better but having this knowledge by itself is important because it helps you to understand the order, the system in the universe and a creator (Allah s.w.t.) have to be there to establish this order.

        <blockquote>
            4) "The sphere of the soul maintains its own shape; it neither extends outward nor sinks inward, it neither disperses nor dies. In contrast, it is illuminated by light, and through it, it sees the truth of everything and the truth within itself."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Another, thought provoking quote. Because, I believe that humans have souls, each one of us have her/his soul. Our body is just outer shell of it, the core (and I feel like the real us) is our souls. So, if everyone has a sould this includes good or bad people. But the difference is bad people have little light or no light, the light spectrum is depends. So if one of them have no light, no light to reflect through her/his soul then they can't see which way to go, they can't understand the true or false, they can't understand themselves because their inside is dark so their proximity too. Atleast this is my rought interpretation from this quote and yes I believe, if you don't have the light which is in this case Islam, Qur'an, if you don't embrace it, then you can not differentiate good or bad and you can not walk on the straight path.

        <blockquote>
            5) "The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape; all are transformations, but none are toward anything, toward what does not exist in the present."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Marcus Aurelius is kind of hitting the heads of people who are claming that we will be nothing after death, and saying you are absolutely wrong with this quote and I love it. Just like a grape, you were born, you experienced many things, became older and died. At each big stage your physical apperance has changed like a grape and your enjoyment towards others has changed maybe as you interact with them (just like how grape's taste changes when its eaten by humans). But all these transformations are towards something; we humans will definitely die and we will be created by Allah (s.w.t.) again. Even Marcus Aurelius had some sort of feeling or thought that our death is not the end and he showed it with this quote (imo) and remember that he was not an ordinary Rome citizen, rather he was an emperor and lived some 2000 years ago.

            There are many other quotes to think about in the book but I wanted to share just some of them. Sometimes, I encounter with some insightful ideas or thoughts from people who I don't share the same world or afterlife views. However, I guess that by doing so they show that they have a piece of truth, a valuable knowledge, not the whole idea maybe but atleast some of it qualifies for it, and if you take them and use them, think about them they can be beneficial for you eventhough that you don't agree with all their writings or ideas. I put this book of Marcus Aurelius in this category.
