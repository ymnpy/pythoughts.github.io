            I hate it. Okay, maybe the word "hate" is a bit exeggeration but seriously I don't like living in aparments. I don't want to sound like a teenager but I just don't like living in an apartment. Have I been always like this ? No. But for the last couple of years I established this "dislike" to live in an apartment. Yes, I want to try to stay appreciative and say Alhamdulillah I have my own place (my mothers actually), I have a roof on top of me and I don't deal with a landlord and don't have to spend a rent fee monthly but still I really really don't like living in an apartment.

            What fueled this feeling to the max is my neighbors. I think what build this dislike the most is <b>noise</b>. I just hate the noise, I just want to sleep, read book, eat something in peace without any of those loud bangs and stuff. Sometimes it is like I am living in a box and people just harassing me by hitting the walls of the box In my previous place I also had noisy neighbors (atleast to my definition, and my definition is <i>Noisiness = Frequency * Magnitude </i> so if someone keeps big noises frequently, they are noisy; but if they drop something once in a while, this makes frequency low and makes them not noisy) and this time even worse. In both places I had to deal with <b>heel walking</b> and <b>window/door slamming</b>. The worst one from two of them is the heel walking. In my current place I talked many times with my downstair neighbor, and she seemed genuine from time to time not gonna lie, but still somehow, someone in that house and not the man of the house, walking on her heels and making that low frequency kind of bass noise. It is really annoying.

            All these stuff made me explore couple of thoughts: first one is, I hate living in apartment, I feel like it just does not suit me. Not only the noise, even if people are living in a perfect harmony in an apartment, we can still hear each other, we don't have enough privacy (this can be due to my apartments structures as well, thin walls or none sound isolation etc.). I don't want people to hear me when I do my business in my toilet, but if we share the bathroom at the same time in an apartment, there is a good probability that we are hearing each other. Or another example, lets say you want to have a romantic evening with your wife or husband, the privacy is important in this case and in apartments hurt this category.

            Second, you need to deal with people and dealing with people is hard maybe you have already experienced it. Dealing with objects, with materials for instance generally are deterministic. If a certain alloy of aluminium known to fail at 500 MPa stress lets say, then in the fifteenth time it will probably fail at that stress level as well so you act knowing that on that material. But with people it is all over the place. Sometimes, while keeping factors the same from your side, they act different. Sometimes they stomp their feet to the floor, sometimes they seem like trying to be careful about that (mostly the first one though). I don't know, the examples can be multiplied but I am pretty sure that human relations is not deterministic. Same inputs won't give you same outputs everytime so from a outside view, this is hard to deal with imo.

            And the third one is, maybe human-kind is not suitable to live in an apartment. I said to myself this first and to my neighbor "yeah, maybe I am not a person who can like in an apartment." but then I thought "who can ?". To live in an apartment, you need to be as noisy as your neighbors and not care about what they do. You should live like they don't exist and you live alone in the whole apartment. Because if you really think like that a) you kind of don't hear them, don't notice them, b) you do whatever you want. I am not suggesting you should do that, I am just telling my observation. In short you need to adapt to the modern society who lives in an apartment with kind of social or moral blindness. Because in my apartment site, I see few people who complain about the noise, others are just adapted and deal with the noise and probably some of the are from those noisers. So a decent human, should not adapt to the society if society is driving on the wrong road and resist their wrong doings and warn them. Plus, as I said before, due to privacy reasons I don't think (again) humans are not suited to live in cramped apartments (I know there are also other types of apartments but I am just entertaining a thought and trying to make a generalization from my experiences). Morever, living in apartments is just a modern time result it is not something we wanted to do but the current system drived us to do, so it is not suited for us. What I mean by that is, after the industrial revolution and capitalistic economy model, business owners needed many workers those workers came from rural, single houses to work and live in cities, cities which has certain capacity. As result, they built apartments to put all those people who work for those businesses in those cramped spaces (I somehow picture soviet kind of gray big apartments with many windows). Therefore, living in apartments is not we want, but something we had to do.

            So, in summary, noise, lack of privacy, dealing with careless people, result of capitalistic society makes me not like living in apartments and think it is not suitable for humans (of course debatable). Not sure about the solution. Maybe mix of adaptation of working from home model more, scattering business all around the country thus reducing population from big cities, better transportation and accessible (money-wise) cars for the people and some incentive from governments can be a solution for the majority. But for me, I am looking forward to live in a beatiful single house, may Allah grant it to me.
