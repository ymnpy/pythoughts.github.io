    <h1>occupation of Palestine and the paranoiac enemy of humanity</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I wanted write about Palestine; the genocide, the occupation happening in there, before getting into other topics because this is important and I feel like I need to write about it. Yes, I am a muslim but I believe it is a fact that the situation, the misery, the genocide, the occupation in Palestine is about whole humanity and not only muslims.<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/10/un-commission-finds-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-israeli-attacks">UN says</a> "crimes against humanity" for the actions of i$rael. It affects the whole world, and humans with some decency should pay attention to this genocide. And to those who knows what is happening and still does not care or have some sort of sympathy towards to the occupier (I am gonna use this word interchangbly with the word i$rael), I genuinely think that something is wrong with them, they have some kind of sickness and this sickness can be harmful to the society that they live in. Because I feel like immoral acts open up doors to other immoral acts. For instance: if someone lies frequently, you can expect that he/she can also steal, harm innocent people etc. So, if you stay idle and does not care or even worse support the occupier you should check yourself and think about the whole situation seriously and seek help.
        </p>

        <p>
            I assume reader have some prior knowledge about this genocide, he/she knows that this did not start in October 7, knows that this occupation has been going on for <a href="https://www.palestineportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LossOfLandMapCard.png">many years</a>, knows that it is horrible, disgraceful, shameful and its supporter governments such as USA and Germany. I want to share some other things about the occupier i$rael, some of their before and recent atrocities, some disgusting facts/info about them. Hopefully it will make the reader realize more that how awful, murderous, disgraceful these evil beings are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing">King David hotel bombing</a>, Terror attack done by zionist Irgun terrorists on 22 July 1946. Bombing and killing 91 people (among them 41 Arabs, 28 British citizens, 17 Jews), often cited as one of the first terror attacks in modern times. </li><br>

            <li>i$rael gave contraceptive to Ethiopian Jews without their consent. Later admitted by the occupiers themselves. The reason is to reduce black jew population (if not worse). (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/28/ethiopian-women-given-contraceptives-israel">just one source from many</a>)</li><br>

            <li>ZAKA organization financial fraud and lying to boost their donations. (<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/zaka-exploited-hamass-october-7-attack-to-campaign-for-donations-report/">source from their own media</a>)</li><br>

            <li>The occupier and its sidekick media lied about <a href="https://mjd.id.au/node/30832">rapes</a> and <a href="https://www.declassifieduk.org/beheaded-babies-how-uk-media-reported-israels-fake-news-as-fact/">beheaded babies</a>. I guess most of the people already knew that, but remember that a liar can lie again so sayings of both i$rael and its media organizations are not trustful, keep that in mind. Also it is important to see that how degenerate beings like Joe Biden <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/12/white-house-walks-back-bidens-claim-he-saw-children-beheaded-by-hamas">lies</a> about "seeing beheaded babies" eventhough the occupiers itself <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-says-it-does-not-have-confirmation-about-allegations-that-hamas-beheaded-babies-/3014787">denies</a> him in a way. They are just giving away themselves.</li><br>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIPAC">AIPAC</a>'s effect on US politics and congress. Is there any other foreign lobby who is puppeting the countries' politicians openly like they do ? Its name is even in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Franklin_espionage_scandal">espionage</a> case in which secrets of US government passed to the AIPAC officials.</li><br>

            <li>The occupiers spit at Christian nuns (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7uL555xWQeE">video link</a>), and you may find out that there are other similar videos showing their hostility towards Christianity.</li><br>

            <li>Microsoft fires employees who organized vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-fired-workers-israel-palestinians-gaza-72de6fe1f35db9398e3b6785203c6bbf"></a>source). There is also a Google case as well <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/18/google-employees-israel-project-nimbus-no-tech-apartheid-firing-reaction/">(No Tech for Apartheid)</a>. Pretty sure if we search enough we can find other examples where people speaking out against this genocide is getting fired in US tech companies.</li><br>

            <li>A bulldozer (yes you read it right, A BULLDOZER) crushed over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a>, an American activist, while defending against demolishing of Palestinian houses. This has happened back in 2003, it is way before October 7.</li><br>

            <li>This paranoiac occupier even hits its own ally. A ship from US called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident#:~:text=The%20USS%20Liberty%20incident%20was,during%20the%20Six%2DDay%20War.">USS Liberty</a> hit by i$rael in 1967, kiling 34 crew members. This one also reminded me of <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230531-13-years-since-israels-attack-on-the-gaza-bound-aid-ship-the-mavi-marmara/">Mavi Marmara aid ship</a> which was carrying aid to Gaza and attacked by the occupier, resulted in killing 10 from Mavi Marmara ship in 31 May 2010.</li><br>

            <li>The occupier killed 7 aid workers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen_aid_convoy_attack#:~:text=The%20World%20Central%20Kitchen%20aid,Strip%2C%20killing%20seven%20aid%20workers.">World Central Kitchen</a> organization by targeting three-car convoy belonging to the organization in 1 April 2024, despite the fact that convoy's route having been coordinated in advance.</li><br>

            <li>i$rael harming (again) its ally USA by keeping bomb plot from them in 1983 which resulted in 241 US marines dying. (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-13-mn-390-story.html">source</a>)</li><br>

            <li>Killing of five year old girl Hind Rajab, her six family members and two paramedics coming to rescue her by i$rael in 29 January 2024. Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hind_Rajab">this</a> well i$raeli sympathizers.</li><br>

            <li>Pedophiles escaping back to i$rael from US (<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/many-accused-jewish-pedophiles-in-us-flee-to-israel-report/">source</a>, it is from one of their media). It is kind of a refuge for those sick beings (<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2016-03-22/ty-article/.premium/israel-becoming-a-refuge-for-pedophiles/0000017f-e11d-df7c-a5ff-e37f5a370000">another source</a> from their own).</li><br>

            <li>Although he was a Jewish person and supporter of i$rael, even Einstein mentioned in his <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210604-the-final-downfall-of-israel-was-predicted-by-einstein/">letter</a> that <i>"terrorist organizations build up from our own ranks"</i> by refering to zionist terror groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">Irgun</a>. I find it interesting that this letter wrote in 1948 which is the decleration date of terror state i$rael and by mentioning these terror groups from their own which is used to terrorize Palestinian people to drive them out from their lands and/or kill them. It is an evident that these terror actions was one of the crimes that i$rael committed that led to this declaration.</li><br>

            <li>At the same Wikipedia page which is giving information about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">Irgun</a>, it is stated that <i>"and the Irgun formally disbanded on January 12, 1949. The Irgun was a political predecessor to Israel's right-wing Herut (or "Freedom") party, which led to today's Likud party. Likud has led or been part of most I$raeli governments since 1977."</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud">Likud</a> is the party of that monster which is running the terror state of i$rael right now. Isn't it interesting that a party which is born out of terrorist organization today also terrorize the same land with a political mask ? Nah, it is not interesting right ? It is evil.

        </ul>

    <p>Above points are just some of the examples that the terror state i$rael has done or has been doing throughout the history. I am pretty sure there are articles, books of tens or hundred of pages which shows more of them. Other than that, I think this occupier, is like a sick, fearful dog that is biting anyone in the proximity and I feel that it is best to get rid of it immediately.</p>
