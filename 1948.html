    <h1>1948 Orwell</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        I don't have any interesting thoughts (I guess) for this one but I'll let it flow. I want to talk about the infamous book 1984 which is written by George Orwell in 1948 (hence the title name, I wanted to reverse the number play made by the author there). I would say it is a valuable book, a classic (if we define a classic book by saying a book which has still effect on the society after so many years it is written). It even make some words get into the english dictionary (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian">Orwellian</a>). So I am going to share some of my notes about this book.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before getting into the notes, I want to say that funnily enough, although it is not intented, I read the book twice (in Turkish translation). I gave the book to a person with the purpose of getting it back, but after so many days I thought I was not getting it back and bought it again. After a second purchase of the book, I felt like I need to read it again and did it. But parallel to this event, I find the idea of reading a valuable book more than once throughout your life is logical. Because at different stages of your life with different experiences you get something new from these books, different perspectives, or you understand things that you did not understand before.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let's get to the book's itself. Orwell, to my understanding, makes a socialism criticism (I heard that he is also making capitalism criticism as well, which make sense) and one thing that is pointed out is that the equality that socialism promises is not applied, it is an illusion. Socio-economic classes are still persist in the book (some may argue that it is not the full intention of socialism rather it is goal of communism, but this is not what I know about socialism). Big portion of the public are living in miserable conditions and others, people who are close to the regime are living well, economically. This is not an uncommon thing in todays world, right ? Now I come to think about it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat">proleteriat</a> people in the book which are also not economically well have atleast some sort of freedom they are not watched extensively as the other government officials, maybe from this perspective their life is not that miserable. To me, they are defined as socially uncompatible and the regime does not hugely care about them. I find this important, being socially uncompatible in a corrup society is a good thing. I think in todays world if you are doing too good, too happy about the world then something must be wrong with you. Because it is normal to give anormal reactions to anormal events as Altay Cem Meriç said, and our world sociologically, morally is anormal today. Anyways, on the other hand, the government officials in the book, like the main character Winston Smith, are living in a delusion, bad conditions, 24/7 surveillance. Now that is a miserable life and Orwell pictures it well. If we think about it this picture is not too unfamiliar to us right ? Most of us don't live in really well conditions economically, life standards of the most people are not high; surveillance by governments is a realy thing, we know it, we hear about it, we know current technology is capable of doing it. Can we also say we are living in a delusion ? I think this is also true for some people, maybe the most of it, with their possessions, with their social media accounts, with their empty titles are just fooling themselves into that they are living a good life with prosperity and freedom.
        </p>

        One of the interesting in the books is that even the people who are close to the regime, doing government's dirty works are under the influence of the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink">doublethink</a> which is I assume introduced to the language with this book. It is basically believing two opposing ideas at the same time another which is an illogical thing to do. These so to say government's minions believe that properity of the nation is increasing, things are going well, everybody is happy and well fed etc. while knowing these are not the fact. I see the examples of it in some people who call themselves muslims as a muslim. They believe in teachings, rules of Islam; they say they are trying to follow it and also support something totally opposite of it. You can't be both a muslim and a homosexuality supporter, this does not make sense, this is doublethinking, you are fooling yourself. The reason behind this behaviour is worth investigating. Maybe they feel an urge to lie themselves so they feel some sort of fake happiness ? Maybe they are trying to be acceptable by the majority of the society so go by their rules ? Maybe they are after a worldy benefit ? Maybe they don't want to deal with some kind of psychological challange ? Because facing with truths may hurt some times, psychologically. Or maybe they have just some sort of mental illness ? I left the answer to you.
        </p>

        I think the governance type in the book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy"></a>oligarchy, that is what I noted from this book. You may ask how about totalitarianism ? Well I am not a political science expert but the applied politics is totalitarianism, the government is oligarchic I would say. There is also a character called "big brother" who is running this government who may not even exist if you think about it. He is just a poster figure, just a visual representation of their ideology so they can amplify its influence I guess. So in the end of, "big brother", a single dictator person is a lie; in reality an elite group holds the power (maybe like today's some corporations ?) and run the country for their worldly benefit.
        </p>

        There are many more ideas worth to explore and think about in the book. There are so many similarities in today's democratic / capitalistic world which makes you think about the current system and hopefully makes you realize how corrupt, inadequate, away from bringing properity to all humans. I personally don't support democracy and capitalistic economic model. I find them false from many perspectives and I know that I am not alone in this one (elaboration about this subject is may due for another writing). Anyways, one of the ideas from the book that I got is that not getting influenced by the slogans or dominant idea of the society. As Marcus Aurelius mentioned in his book Meditations, we need to see things as they really are, we need to look into them and think about them seriously. Don't get influenced by the popular views, think about them, see through them if they are beneficial, then okay, take them but if they are not abandon them and don't be fooled by them. It doesn't matter majority of the people are doing it, facts are not calculated by the number of its followers. If something is bad no matter how many people are doing it, it is still bad. This reminds of english translation of a verse in the Qur'an:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <b>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be dazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O  people of reason, so you may be successful.”</b><i>(Surah Al-Ma'idah, Ayat 100, english translation)</i>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Some may remind themselves ending of the book (its plausibility is debatable, imo) and say all these hustle is worthless but I would disagree. I think George Orwell just gave us an example of one human, the main character, under those circumstances but we know that from the history there are many people who stick with good principals, did not change their minds on those, differentiated between truths and lies and succeeded, even in the worse conditions than the book. So they can force you to do many things but they can't forcefully change your mind, change your ideas if you don't allow them to do. Thus, we need to think, read (and even write), develop ourselves. We need to protect ourselves, especially our minds while there are so many deceivers out there. We need to stick to the good moral principals and try to do good things always, no matter what society does, no matter what time we live in.
