    <h1>cybersecurity vs AI</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        I know the title may sound illogical I give you that one, since you don't have to make a choice between these two; AI can be used in cybersecurity, yes I know that. But I want to share a random thought came to my mind. So hear me out (or read me out ? I am not sure).
        </p>

        <p>
        I have been having interest in these both fields and as an amateur I made some practical stuff in both of them and actually used machine learning (more specifically these three algorithms: random forest, extreme gradient boosting and neural network) in my master thesis. My cybersecurity interest on the other hand comes from mostly my emotions (I guess), to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWN">pwn</a> bad people, to get attention of some people who think they are powerful or something such as corrupt corporation or government leaders, to accomplish something by yourself without a team or some extra resources and plush to get that adrenaline, that dopamine rush. But in the end if I had to choose one of these fields I would go for cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
        The reason for that is to accomplish great things in AI you need resouces, serious resources such as clusters of computers, more likely GPUs to have huge computation power and even greater amount of data. I feel like we are just end users of big AI companies in this case, they are making the breakthroughs. I wonder big innovations in AI whether came from academic researchers or from corporations lately. Probably the latter has the highest probability. Of course the techniques may change and it may be possible to train models with less data but I have doubt for the computation. Even us, humans, to master something I believe we make huge amount of computations through some amount of time. So in the end being an AI practitioner can give you a good salary in big tech companies (yes, companies again) but still makes you dependent on them, on the current system and the goal I think should be the opposite of it, should be becoming indepent of the current capitalist system. Also let me remind you that AI or machine learning (as a subfield of AI) is just a tool, and it is a mistake to make a tool your goal. You can't write software just to write software, you can't train AI models just to train them, what is your end goal in this business, what aare you trying to accomplish using these tools ? You want to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a> ? Fine, but there is a slim slim possiblity that you can accomplish this due to reasons I mentioned before (resources), big companies are way ahead of you, they have more human hours with their employees, more hardware and more data. Sorry to be that guy to tell you that you just can't do it but I think this is just the fact imo. Maybe you want to build a little AI application for your company, but you see the problem again ? It is for a company, remember we are trying to become independent of the system, to acquaire a skill that can benefit you without need of corporation resources and alike.
        </p>

        <p>
        So from this perspective cybersecurity is much much more attractive, at least for me, at least for now and I am not abandoning machine learning or AI, just writing out loud (I made up this phrase by remember "thinking out loud", hope it make sense). First, you only need a computer and internet to work in this field and make great impact. You may think that "internet is a resource which is not owned by you, so doesn't it make you also dependent ?", well you have a point, I guess we are so intertwined that maybe fully independence is not possible for cybersecurity stuff but you may also think this as using enemy's tool against themselves. I use their tools, not being dependent on them and hackers do that right ? As I said it before, you don't need too many resources. Again, you may say that "some attacks like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDOS</a>, you need thosands of computer bots, this is need for some serious resources.", but even that, acquiring control of thousands of computers is achievable by only starting with one computer. So initially you start with minimal amount of resources. Second, your impact is not like making a mediocre image recognition tool or making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a> which mostly hallucinates but entertain you nonetheless, no, with great offensive security skills you can make governments listen to you, you can get into Pentagon for instance, which in physical world, you may not even able to pass by its gates. You can bring attention to injustice by computer codes and do something about it. You can actually change things and you can do these and more independently. I think there is a big value here. Also to secure or attack information system to accomplish something is a valid goal by itself, not a tool. You use tool on the process of doing it. So you avoid that mistake of making a tool your goal. Moreover, along the way there is a great possbility that you will understand computers more than most of the software or AI engineers by learning about operating systems, networks, hardware etc. and you won't be missing out on programming side as well. You will make computer bend to your will its imore than just making an application for profit of a company even if the company is actually yours. Also one more thing that I want to mention which is, in the world of increasing performance of LLM models which themselves are also capable of writing code now (good or bad, that is debatable), knowing a skill that is not shared through these LLMs (I am talking about hacking techniques) is like having a rare object, it is like knowing a mostly unknown information. I find this also attractive. Plus, I do not even go into the subject of how importance cybersecurity will be in a world with internet of things, robotics and AI.
        </p>

        <p>
        As conclusion, I can't say that what I wrote here is 100% true. These are just my preliminarty thoughts, my raw opinions but I feel like there is some truth in it. So think about it by yourself please and make good decisions.
